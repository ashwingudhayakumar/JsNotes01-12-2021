only execute after first part(if) fails,then this correct means it excutes

//performance Review


if (rating ===3)console.log('you are a superstar')

if(rating >=2)console.log('meets expectation')

if rating =3 means both this statement executed,no meaning at all


so only if else if comes into the picture

if (rating ===3)console.log('you are a superstar')

else if(rating >=2)console.log('meets expectation')


this makes sense that else if execute only if not executes

(note else if may use only one or two conditions can bring falsy results)
