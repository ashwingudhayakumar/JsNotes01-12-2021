how to store 


total steps

total floors

total miles

avg.daily calorie burn

total active minutes

exercising this week

avg.restful sleep





with just index based you cant store this variety of information in this



An object comes into the picture:


const fitBitData={
	totalSteps:308727,
	totalMiles:211.7,
	avgCalorieBurn:5755,
	workoutsThisWeek:'5 of 7',
	avgGoodSleep :'2:13'
};


objects are collection of properties

we already see the property

length property

properties are a key value pair

rather than accessing data using an index,we use custom keys.
