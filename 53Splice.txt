inserting in middle we go for splice


.splice(start index[,count to delete element,[insert elements]])



you cant make dummy copy in splice



.splice(0) means then it contains only empty array,it mutate 


.splice(0,0) means the ref var doesn't contain anything it contains only have empty array


1st arg is start index,2nd arg is count to delete element,3rd arg is inserting element

 

 splice is only to manipulate things in that array
