function expressions

thers another syntax we can use to define funtions:

usually function square(num){
	return num *num;
}



but here


const square=function(num){
	return num*num; //this is called anonymous function
}

how we can write like this

because functions are objects

we can put them in variable

we can store 10 of them in an array




const product=function multiply(x,y){
	return x*y;//named function but you cant call with this name
}

call by only product not multiply
