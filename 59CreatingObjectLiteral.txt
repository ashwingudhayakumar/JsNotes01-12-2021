{}->object literal
[]->array literal



key can be anytype

everything going to convert into string

while accessing also we can just enter without quotes it convert into string

we can access with . as well []

where . search for exact samething like variable that store something wouldn't convert and search for key

but [] this either search for direct or convert and search

. only used to call by using string,but not by converting string on spot as well as another variable
